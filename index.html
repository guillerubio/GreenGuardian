      <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Abstract</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Green Guardian</strong> project addresses substantial economic losses in the houseplant industry,
        where a significant portion of plants perish annually due to neglect. This <strong>IoT device</strong>
        simplifies plant care to a near-autonomous level, focusing primarily on <strong>precise soil humidity
          management</strong> through its integrated watering system. Once installed, Green Guardian monitors soil
        moisture and <em>adjusts watering schedules accordingly</em>, ensuring plants receive exactly what they need
        without risk of over or underwatering. It also monitors environmental factors such as light and temperature and
        advises owners when adjustments are needed to maintain optimal conditions. Powered by an
        <strong>energy-harvesting system</strong>, the device minimizes its environmental footprint and operates
        independently of external power sources. With its <strong>cloud-connected capabilities</strong>, Green Guardian
        offers users remote monitoring and minimal interaction, making it an ideal solution for ensuring plant health
        with little to no effort. This device not only promises to extend the life of houseplants but also to transform
        plant care into a hassle-free, sustainable routine.

      <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
      <p>Americans invest approximately $16 billion annually in houseplants. Sadly, it is estimated that nearly half of
        these plants die due to improper care, which indicates a substantial gap in the consumer knowledge or available
        technology aiding in plant maintenance.</p>
      <p>This situation presents a significant opportunity for innovation in the home gardening industry, particularly
        through the development of smart technologies that can reduce plant mortality rates and enhance user experience.

      <h2>Technical Approach: Details</h2>
      <p>The project proposes the creation of the Green Guardian, an IoT device designed to simplify plant care to a
        near-autonomous level. This device will manage watering schedules based on soil humidity data it collects,
        adjusting water delivery to the specific needs of each plant.</p>
      <div class="center">

          class="implementation-diagram">
      </div>


      <p>Key components of the device include sensors for soil moisture, ambient light, and temperature, a water
        delivery system, and a power management unit featuring solar energy harvesting. This integrated system ensures
        that plants receive optimal care without requiring constant human intervention.</p>

      <h2>Product Survey - Preliminary Data</h2>
      <p>A survey was conducted with 119 participants to gauge potential user interest in the Green Guardian. Questions
        aimed to assess how often individuals interact with their plants and their interest in a self-sustaining plant
        care system.</p>

      <p>The survey results for the Green Guardian product reveal promising insights into the market's readiness and
        potential interest in an autonomous plant care solution. A majority of respondents interact with their plants
        frequently (daily or several times a week), indicating an existing commitment to plant care that the Green
        Guardian could support and enhance. Additionally, a significant number of respondents reported having plants
        that died prematurely, suggesting a prevalent challenge in maintaining plant health that the Green Guardian aims
        to address. Importantly, the strong inclination towards a self-contained watering system, with a substantial
        majority expressing interest, underscores the demand for such innovative solutions. This interest, coupled with
        respondents' willingness to invest in the price range of $20 to $60, positions the Green Guardian as a viable
        product in the houseplant care market.</p>

      <h2> Sensor Selection, Fusion and Calibration</h2>
      <p>Environmental factors that affect plant growth and include light, temperature, water, humidity and
        nutrition.​[16]
        The first four parameters: light, temperature, humidity and soil moisture (through watering) are readily
        measurable using cost-effective off-the-shelf sensors, which we procured. Nutrition is tougher to sense and
        requires more expensive approaches such as spectroscopy, wifi signal, pH, ion-selective electrodes.​ Since our
        design goals require an affordable solution, we decided to forgo the pH sensor (cheapest option would cost $70).
      </p>
      <p>As we do not want affordability of the system to compromise the quality, we needed to calibrate the sensors so
        that the data they produce is reliable. We began with calibrating our DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The
        below method involved taking initial readings from the sensor and comparing it to the temperature and humidity
        values as measured by an iPhone. We then calibrated the sensor readings to the correct value through one-stop
        calibration.
        The sensor calibration code is available on our github repository.

      <h2>Plant Care through Actuation</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to take care of a plant with minimal or no human effort. To this end, we decided to design an
        actuation
        system that would water the plant as and when directed by a decision making model. This decision making model is
        designed
        by utilizing the plant specific care instructions, along with the sensor data for soil moisutre and ambient
        light.</p>
      <p>We define some terms for our system:
        <li>Environment: Plant + data collected by sensors​</li>
        <li>State: Current conditions of the plant defined by data collected from soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
          and ambient light sensors.​</li>
        <li>Agent: Arduino Controller</li>
        <li>Action: Water the plant / Do not water the plant​</li>
      </p>

      <h3> Initial Approach: Rule Based Decision Making</h3>
      <li> Use thresholds based on plant specific care instructions: watering frequency, light requirements, other
        conditions (e.g., water after soil is completely dried out).</li>
      <li> Do not water plants at night.​ Because of absence of sunlight, leaves do not dry off and are prone to fungal
        infestations.</li>
      <li> Water specific amount corresponding to plant care instructions.​</li>

      <h3> Advanced Approach: Actuation-with-Learning</h3>
      <li>Develop a comprehensive dataset from plant sensor data collected over several days.​</li>
      <li>Establish a correlation between the plant's condition and actuation actions, focusing on watering frequency
        and volume.​</li>
      <li>Utilize this "learning" approach to create a plant-specific model.​</li>
      <li>Enhance decision-making processes by optimizing factors such as thresholds and watering parameters.​</li>

      <h2> Energy Autonomy through Energy Harvesting</h2>
      Our system goals are self-sufficiency, long lifespan, and energy efficiency. However, the system components are
      battery powered and will get depleted over time.​ Therefore, we
      design an energy harvesting system to power GreenGuardian as a stand-alone, long-term solution.
      <li>Perform energy profiling to realize energy consumption.​</li>
      <li>Harvest Solar Energy to power system.​</li>
      <li>Apply optimization techniques.​</li>
      <div class="center">
        <img src="/assets/Energy_Harvesting.webp" style="width: 80%" alt="Energy harvesting component specifications">
      </div>

      <h3>Optimization Techniques</h3>
      <li>Have <b>separate power sources</b> for sensing module and control module.​
        - Gives software control over sensor activation and operation.</li>
      <li>Sensor data is <b>not highly variable</b>, so we are not sensing continuously​. Sensors are turned off and
        Arduino is in low-power mode for majority of the time.​</li>
      <li><b>Adaptive Duty Cycling</b> ​- Battery is charged on good weather days, and sensor activity is lessened on
        bad weather days (Low Battery Level + Ambient Light below threshold)​.
        This enables us to adapt duty cycling to battery power and availability of ambient light.​</li>

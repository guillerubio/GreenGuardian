      <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Abstract</h2>
      <p>The Green Guardian project aims to address economic and environmental losses in the houseplant industry due to
        neglect. This IoT device simplifies plant care with near-autonomous soil moisture management and an integrated
        watering system. It monitors key variables (light, soil moisture, humidity, temperature), adjusts watering
        schedules, and indicates optimal plant placement. Powered by an energy-harvesting system, Green Guardian
        minimizes environmental impact and operates independently of external power sources.

    <section id="problem-definition">
      <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
      <p>In the United States alone, consumers spend approximately billions annually on houseplants and related
        accessories <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. Despite this investment, around half of these plants die prematurely due to
        neglect and improper care <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. This not only results in financial losses but also
        contributes to environmental waste, as valuable resources such as water, soil, and plant materials are
        squandered. The primary issues include a lack of proper plant care knowledge, as many plant owners lack the
        necessary expertise to maintain optimal conditions for their houseplants, leading to overwatering,
        underwatering, insufficient light, and poor environmental conditions. Additionally, busy lifestyles often
        prevent individuals from dedicating the necessary time and attention to their plants, resulting in neglect and
        inconsistent care routines. Improper care practices also lead to the wasteful use of resources such as water and
        fertilizers, which has broader environmental implications. Furthermore, the premature death of plants results in
        discarded plant material, contributing to landfill waste and the unnecessary consumption of resources used in
        plant production and distribution.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="motivation">
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>The motivation behind the Green Guardian project stems from the desire to address the significant economic and
        environmental issues associated with houseplant care. Americans spend approximately billions annually on
        houseplants <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, yet around half of these plants die prematurely due to neglect and improper
        care <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. This not only results in financial losses but also leads to environmental waste,
        as resources such as water, soil, and plant materials are squandered.</p>

      <p>Green Guardian aims to mitigate these issues by providing an IoT-based solution that automates plant care,
        ensuring optimal conditions for plant health with minimal human intervention. The project seeks to reduce plant
        mortality, promote sustainable practices, and enhance the overall experience of plant ownership by using an edge
        system capable of sensing, decision-making, and actuating. Additionally, we aim to collect data on individual
        plants to address the current lack of detailed plant care information, which could be highly beneficial for
        advancements in the agricultural and environmental fields.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="hardware">
      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <p>The components and design used for this project focused on its constraints and requirements: energy efficiency,
        plant care through sensing, decision-making, and actuation, and minimal user intervention.</p>

      <h3 id="architecture">System Architecture and Component Specification</h3>
      <p>The system, as seen in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, is divided into four units: control, sensing, power
        management, and actuation. All of the hardware used for this project was over-the-counter and specified in the
        Components Used in the Project.</p>

      <p>The control unit is centered around the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi [ABX00087], featuring the Renesas RA4M1 and
        ESP32-S3 for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. This microcontroller was chosen for its robust performance, ease
        of use, extensive community support, network support, affordability, pins, and peripheral compatibility.
        Additionally, we chose this Arduino model for its integrated LED matrix, which can serve as a notification
        system for the user.</p>

      <p>The sensing unit is made up of four sensors that allow measurement of five essential variables for plant care:
        soil moisture, environment temperature, air humidity, light exposure, and remaining water in storage. We chose
        these because "environmental factors that affect plant growth include light, temperature, water, humidity, and
        nutrition" <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. Measuring soil nutrition is still unaffordable and complex, so we based our
        model on the other factors. The sensors we used were the lowest consuming and most affordable ones available in
        our market.</p>

      <p>The power management unit is composed of a solar controller, a battery, and a solar cell. We deemed solar
        energy as the most effective energy harvesting method given the environmental factors needed for plants to
        thrive and its ample energy collection ability. The 3.7V 1000mAh LiPo battery provides reliable energy storage,
        ensuring continuous operation during low-light conditions.</p>

      <p>Finally, the actuation unit is composed of a standard servo. The servo is connected to a valve that enables
        drip irrigation. We chose this irrigation system for two reasons. First, it takes advantage of the potential
        energy from storing water above the plants, allowing gravity to assist in water delivery. Second, drip
        irrigation is 90% efficient in allowing plants to use the applied water, and it reduces runoff and evaporation
        <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>, making this system highly suitable for our requirements.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Fig. 1: Implementation Diagram</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="sensor-calibration">Sensor Calibration</h3>
      <p>To ensure our decision-making model had accurate data input, and given that the sensors involved in this
        project could compromise accuracy for affordability, sensor calibration was necessary for all of them.</p>
      <p>The moisture sensor is capacitive, returning arbitrary values that only had relative meaning in the context of
        the data points it collected. Because of this, we had to create a function to map these arbitrary values to soil
        moisture content percentages. To achieve this, we dried the soil in an oven until it reached a consistent
        weight, indicating minimal levels of moisture, which allowed us to measure 0% soil moisture. After this, we
        determined the field capacity (100% moisture content) by thoroughly watering the soil sample until it was
        completely saturated and then letting it drain until consistent. You can see both of these samples in <a
          href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>. With these capacitive thresholds, we were able to map arbitrary values to actual
        moisture percentages.</p>

      <p>The rest of the sensors returned their values in International System units, so the only calibration needed was
        accuracy-based. Our approach for them was to use one-point calibration. For example, we had to add an offset to
        our humidity and temperature sensor values as they were inconsistent with other local, more accurate sensors.
      </p>

          class="implementation-diagram">
        <figcaption>Fig. 2: Soil Moisture Calibration Samples</figcaption>

        <h3 id="energy-profiling">Energy Profiling</h3>
        <p>We need to understand how much the setup consumes to make decisions regarding energy conservation, sleep
          time, and sensing times. For this, we used a multimeter to measure the energy consumption of our device in
          different states. The measurements are as follows:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>In low power mode, the CPU consumes 140 mA.</li>
          <li>In normal mode, the CPU consumes 160 mA.</li>
          <li>When the CPU is sensing, it consumes 180 mA.</li>
          <li>When the servo is active, it consumes 240 mA.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="actuation-unit">
      <h2>Actuation Unit: Irrigation Technique</h2>
      <p>For this project, the actuation unit needed to be energy-efficient, effective, and capable of conserving
        resources while delivering water directly to the plant roots. Given the project constraints, we opted for a
        servo-activated valve to utilize the potential energy of the water in the bottle. Drip irrigation is known to be
        90% efficient in allowing plants to absorb the water applied, significantly reducing runoff and evaporation
        (University of Rhode Island, n.d.). Consequently, we decided to fabricate our own drip irrigation system using
        an irrigation dripper, a valve, and a servo motor to control the water flow. The servo motor is managed by an
        Arduino, which is in turn regulated by the decision-making model. Below is a video demonstration of how our
        system works.</p>

    <section id="product-survey">
      <h2>Product Survey - Preliminary Data</h2>
      <p>A survey was conducted with 119 participants to gauge potential user interest in the Green Guardian.
        Questions
        aimed to assess how often individuals interact with their plants and their interest in a self-sustaining plant
        care system.</p>
      <p>The survey results for the Green Guardian product reveal promising insights into the market's readiness and
        potential interest in an autonomous plant care solution. A majority of respondents interact with their plants
        frequently (daily or several times a week), indicating an existing commitment to plant care that the Green
        Guardian could support and enhance. Additionally, a significant number of respondents reported having plants
        that died prematurely, suggesting a prevalent challenge in maintaining plant health that the Green Guardian
        aims
        to address. Importantly, the strong inclination towards a self-contained watering system, with a substantial
        majority expressing interest, underscores the demand for such innovative solutions. This interest, coupled
        with
        respondents' willingness to invest in the price range of $20 to $60, positions the Green Guardian as a viable
        product in the houseplant care market.</p>

    <section id="plant-care">
      <h2>Plant Care through Actuation</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to take care of a plant with minimal or no human effort. To this end, we decided to design an
        actuation system that would water the plant as and when directed by a decision making model. This decision
        making model is designed by utilizing the plant specific care instructions, along with the sensor data for
        soil
        moisture and ambient light.</p>
      <p>We define some terms for our system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Environment: Plant + data collected by sensors</li>
        <li>State: Current conditions of the plant defined by data collected from soil moisture, temperature,
          humidity,
          and ambient light sensors.</li>
        <li>Agent: Arduino Controller</li>
        <li>Action: Water the plant / Do not water the plant</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Initial Approach: Rule Based Decision Making</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use thresholds based on plant specific care instructions: watering frequency, light requirements, other
          conditions (e.g., water after soil is completely dried out).</li>
        <li>Do not water plants at night. Because of absence of sunlight, leaves do not dry off and are prone to
          fungal
          infestations.</li>
        <li>Water specific amount corresponding to plant care instructions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advanced Approach: Actuation-with-Learning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a comprehensive dataset from plant sensor data collected over several days.</li>
        <li>Establish a correlation between the plant's condition and actuation actions, focusing on watering
          frequency
          and volume.</li>
        <li>Utilize this "learning" approach to create a plant-specific model.</li>
        <li>Enhance decision-making processes by optimizing factors such as thresholds and watering parameters.</li>

      <h2>Energy Autonomy through Energy Harvesting</h2>
      <p>Our system goals are self-sufficiency, long lifespan, and energy efficiency. However, the system components
        are
        battery powered and will get depleted over time. Therefore, we design an energy harvesting system to power

    <section id="related-work">
      <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Related Work</h2>
      <p>Various researchers have explored the design of IoT-based smart plant monitoring systems. Judika et al.
        investigated the potential benefits of such a system in monitoring Chili plants in Indonesia [2]. Their system
        is capable of monitoring the moisture, pH, and salinity of the soil and autonomously adjusting these
        parameters
        using water, pH up/down liquid, and AB mix, respectively [2]. While the system functions effectively in the
        field, it is specifically designed to cater to a single type of plant. Kush et al. endeavored to broaden the
        scope of plant monitoring by introducing a smart pot [1]. However, this approach is marred by two significant
        flaws: users are required to replace their existing pots with smart pots, and the pot relies on a user to
        regularly charge its battery. Antti et al. devised an AI system capable of monitoring plant health, yet it
        relies on human intervention for plant care based on the interpreted data [3]. The limitations of previous
        research underscore the importance of developing a self-sufficient autonomous plant monitoring system.</p>
      <div class="related-body">
        <h3>Sensor Modalities</h3>
        <p>For monitoring plant health, there are various features that need to be observed and maintained, such as
          soil
          health through pH and moisture content sensing, amount of ambient light and humidity. These parameters can
          be
          conveniently calculated using IoT sensors, and are paramount for effective monitoring. The collected data
          assists in making decisions about irrigation, soil nutrition, and determining which plant types to grow. The
          pH sensor serves the purpose of monitoring the nutrient levels necessary for the growth of a plant [10]. The
          soil moisture sensor functions to assess the moisture content within the soil, mitigating the risk of plant
          desiccation due to inadequate watering practices [1,2]. Additionally, the monitoring of air temperature and
          humidity, often facilitated by the DHT11 sensor, stands as another crucial aspect of plant monitoring
          systems
          [1, 2, 10].</p>
        <h3>Energy Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Ideally, IoT systems should be self-sustainable and functional for a long period of time. Especially for
          our
          approach to a self-contained plant monitoring system that requires minimal to no human interference, we
          would
          like to ensure a longer network lifetime. With this is mind, using batteries as the primary or only power
          source poses several challenges, as highlighted in [7]: (i) finite lifetime, (ii) depletion and leakage
          issues, (iii) expensive maintenance and replacement costs, (iv) effects due to temperature, (v) impact of
          battery chemicals on surrounding environment, (vi) problems in maintenance and replacement due to IoT
          systems
          deployment in inaccessible or remote locations. Therefore, we have to come up with energy harvesting (EH)
          techniques to provide secondary power sources or even replace batteries altogether. Work by T. Sanislav et
          al.
          extensively investigates the major energy sources that can be used for EH and subsequent models for this
          purpose, choosing either an immediate Harvest-Use or Harvest-Store-Use model [8].</p>

        <p>The work by T. Sanislav evaluated a host of EH sources, encompassing ambient, human, organic, mechanical,
          and
          hybrid sources. Criteria for evaluation included (i) technology, (ii) power density, (iii) controllability,
          (iv) predictability, and (v) availability. Based on their findings, solar energy is easily and naturally
          available, and delivers the highest power density of approximately 15 mW/cm2, as compared to various other
          energy harvesting techniques [9]. Limitations of solar energy as EH source include (i) uncontrollability,
          (ii)
          unavailability during night, and (iii) effects on weather, season, etc. However, these limitations can be
          effectively mitigated by utilizing the predictability of such effects. As light, or sunlight is one of the
          primary requirements for plant growth, utilizing solar energy to both recharge and power our IoT system is a
          logical choice.</p>

        <p>Along with selecting a viable energy source, we also need to harvest energy in a way that suits our
          system’s
          needs and components. Primarily, we should focus on the amount of energy generated and consumed. In case of
          sources such as solar energy which generates a high-output voltage, far more than the requirement of our
          low-power IoT system, it is wise to store energy for later use, for eg. during night, or when availability
          of
          solar energy is dampened due to weather or seasonal variations. Due to its nature as an uncontrollable but
          predictable resource, solar energy lends itself to a harvest-store-use model for uninterrupted operation
          [12],
          [13]. Several approaches have been explored to maximize data transmission rate [14], [15] through optimal
          scheduling schemes for power management. In [7], the authors have designed a solar-powered environmental BLE
          beacon, that allowed stand-alone operation, with the solar cells being capable of charging the accumulator
          within a single day with good weather. A similar approach replacing solar with RF showed lesser amounts of
          scavenged energy.</p>

        <h3>Setup/System Outline</h3>
        <p>Various researchers have explored the design of IoT-based smart plant monitoring systems. Judika et al.
          investigated the potential benefits of such a system in monitoring Chili plants in Indonesia [2]. Their
          system
          is capable of monitoring the moisture, pH, and salinity of the soil and autonomously adjusting these
          parameters using water, pH up/down liquid, and AB mix, respectively [2]. While the system functions
          effectively in the field, it is specifically designed to cater to a single type of plant. Kush et al.
          endeavored to broaden the scope of plant monitoring by introducing a smart pot [1]. However, this approach
          is
          marred by two significant flaws: users are required to replace their existing pots with smart pots, and the
          pot relies on a user to regularly charge its battery. Antti et al. devised an AI system capable of
          monitoring
          plant health, yet it relies on human intervention for plant care based on the interpreted data [3]. The
          limitations of previous research underscore the importance of developing a self-sufficient autonomous plant
          monitoring system.</p>
        <h3>Cloud computing</h3>
        <p>Cloud connectivity constitutes a crucial aspect of plant monitoring systems. Wi-Fi stands as the
          predominant
          interface for network connectivity [2,3]. Nevertheless, Bluetooth, particularly its variant Bluetooth Low
          Energy (BLE), consumes less power and serves as an optimal choice for connecting to smartphones [4].
          Ethernet,
          as a wired connectivity option, offers a reliable connection [1]. The communication of plant health data to
          users commonly occurs through smartphone apps [1]. Alternatively, websites or web apps, which are
          platform-agnostic, present another viable option [2, 3].</p>
        <h3>Irrigation Techniques</h3>
        <p>Effective irrigation techniques are essential for maintaining plants alive, as precise delivery of water to
          the roots profoundly impacts their overall health and development. Some irrigation systems designed for
          efficiency and minimal human intervention have been designed in the past. Judika et al. discuss automated
          sprinkler and monitoring systems specifically designed for chili plants in urban settings. These systems use
          a
          combination of soil moisture sensors and Arduino controllers to regulate watering based on the soil's
          moisture
          content.</p>
        <p>Sensor fusion is an essential component for plant monitoring. It is necessary to integrate data from
          various
          sources such as moisture, humidity, light and temperature to ensure precise soil humidity management and
          optimal plant health. Previous research by Misra et al. offers examples into how sensor fusion is able to
          enhance IoT functionality by combining multiple sensor inputs to achieve more accurate, robust and reliable
          models of the physical environment. Applying sensor fusion is important, as the results of efficient sensor
          fusion are almost always better than those obtained from the interpretation of data from individual sensors
          [5]. However, there are many challenges to implementing sensor fusion within the constraints of IoT.
          Handling
          voluminous and heterogeneous data efficiently, ensuring real-time processing and maintaining scalability, as
          discussed by Krishnamurthi et al. Additionally, research focusing specifically on sensor fusion for
          houseplant
          environments remains scarce, underscoring a significant gap in current studies.</p>

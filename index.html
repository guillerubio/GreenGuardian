      <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
      <p>Americans invest approximately $16 billion annually in houseplants. Sadly, it is estimated that nearly half of
        these plants die due to improper care, which indicates a substantial gap in the consumer knowledge or available
        technology aiding in plant maintenance.</p>
      <p>This situation presents a significant opportunity for innovation in the home gardening industry, particularly
        through the development of smart technologies that can reduce plant mortality rates and enhance user experience.

    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    <p>
      Various researchers have explored the design of IoT-based smart plant monitoring systems. Judika et al.
      investigated the potential benefits of such a system in monitoring Chili plants in Indonesia [2]. Their system
      is
      capable of monitoring the moisture, pH, and salinity of the soil and autonomously adjusting these parameters
      using
      water, pH up/down liquid, and AB mix, respectively [2]. While the system functions effectively in the field, it
      is
      specifically designed to cater to a single type of plant. Kush et al. endeavored to broaden the scope of plant
      monitoring by introducing a smart pot [1]. However, this approach is marred by two significant flaws: users are
      required to replace their existing pots with smart pots, and the pot relies on a user to regularly charge its
      battery. Antti et al. devised an AI system capable of monitoring plant health, yet it relies on human
      intervention
      for plant care based on the interpreted data [3]. The limitations of previous research underscore the importance
      of developing a self-sufficient autonomous plant monitoring system.
    </p>

    <div class="related-body">
      <h3>Sensor Modalities</h3>
      <p>For monitoring plant health, there are various features that need to be observed and maintained, such as soil
        health through pH and moisture content sensing, amount of ambient light and humidity. These parameters can be
        conveniently calculated using IoT sensors, and are paramount for effective monitoring. The collected data
        assists in making decisions about irrigation, soil nutrition, and determining which plant types to grow. The
        pH
        sensor serves the purpose of monitoring the nutrient levels necessary for the growth of a plant [10]. The soil
        moisture sensor functions to assess the moisture content within the soil, mitigating the risk of plant
        desiccation due to inadequate watering practices [1,2]. Additionally, the monitoring of air temperature and
        humidity, often facilitated by the DHT11 sensor, stands as another crucial aspect of plant monitoring systems
        [1, 2, 10].
      </p>
      <h3>
        Energy Harvesting</h3>
      <p>
        Ideally, IoT systems should be self-sustainable and functional for a long period of time. Especially for our
        approach to a self-contained plant monitoring system that requires minimal to no human interference, we would
        like to ensure a longer network lifetime. With this is mind, using batteries as the primary or only power
        source
        poses several challenges, as highlighted in [7]: (i) finite lifetime, (ii) depletion and leakage issues, (iii)
        expensive maintenance and replacement costs, (iv) effects due to temperature, (v) impact of battery chemicals
        on
        surrounding environment, (vi) problems in maintenance and replacement due to IoT systems deployment in
        inaccessible or remote locations. Therefore, we have to come up with energy harvesting (EH) techniques to
        provide secondary power sources or even replace batteries altogether. Work by T. Sanislav et al. extensively
        investigates the major energy sources that can be used for EH and subsequent models for this purpose, choosing
        either an immediate Harvest-Use or Harvest-Store-Use model [8].

        The work by T. Sanislav evaluated a host of EH sources, encompassing ambient, human, organic, mechanical, and
        hybrid sources. Criteria for evaluation included (i) technology, (ii) power density, (iii) controllability,
        (iv)
        predictability, and (v) availability. Based on their findings, solar energy is easily and naturally available,
        and delivers the highest power density of approximately 15 mW/cm2, as compared to various other energy
        harvesting techniques [9]. Limitations of solar energy as EH source include (i) uncontrollability, (ii)
        unavailability during night, and (iii) effects on weather, season, etc. However, these limitations can be
        effectively mitigated by utilizing the predictability of such effects. As light, or sunlight is one of the
        primary requirements for plant growth, utilizing solar energy to both recharge and power our IoT system is a
        logical choice.

        Along with selecting a viable energy source, we also need to harvest energy in a way that suits our system’s
        needs and components. Primarily, we should focus on the amount of energy generated and consumed. In case of
        sources such as solar energy which generates a high-output voltage, far more than the requirement of our
        low-power IoT system, it is wise to store energy for later use, for eg. during night, or when availability of
        solar energy is dampened due to weather or seasonal variations. Due to its nature as an uncontrollable but
        predictable resource, solar energy lends itself to a harvest-store-use model for uninterrupted operation [12],
        [13]. Several approaches have been explored to maximize data transmission rate [14], [15] through optimal
        scheduling schemes for power management. In [7], the authors have designed a solar-powered environmental BLE
        beacon, that allowed stand-alone operation, with the solar cells being capable of charging the accumulator
        within a single day with good weather. A similar approach replacing solar with RF showed lesser amounts of
        scavenged energy.

      <h3>
        Setup/System Outline</h3>
      <p> Various researchers have explored the design of IoT-based smart plant monitoring systems. Judika et al.
        investigated the potential benefits of such a system in monitoring Chili plants in Indonesia [2]. Their system
        is capable of monitoring the moisture, pH, and salinity of the soil and autonomously adjusting these
        parameters
        using water, pH up/down liquid, and AB mix, respectively [2]. While the system functions effectively in the
        field, it is specifically designed to cater to a single type of plant. Kush et al. endeavored to broaden the
        scope of plant monitoring by introducing a smart pot [1]. However, this approach is marred by two significant
        flaws: users are required to replace their existing pots with smart pots, and the pot relies on a user to
        regularly charge its battery. Antti et al. devised an AI system capable of monitoring plant health, yet it
        relies on human intervention for plant care based on the interpreted data [3]. The limitations of previous
        research underscore the importance of developing a self-sufficient autonomous plant monitoring system.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Cloud computing </h3>
      <p>
        Cloud connectivity constitutes a crucial aspect of plant monitoring systems. Wi-Fi stands as the predominant
        interface for network connectivity [2,3]. Nevertheless, Bluetooth, particularly its variant Bluetooth Low
        Energy
        (BLE), consumes less power and serves as an optimal choice for connecting to smartphones [4]. Ethernet, as a
        wired connectivity option, offers a reliable connection [1]. The communication of plant health data to users
        commonly occurs through smartphone apps [1]. Alternatively, websites or web apps, which are platform-agnostic,
        present another viable option [2, 3].
      </p>
      <h3>
        Irrigation Techniques
      </h3>
      <p>
        Effective irrigation techniques are essential for maintaining plants alive, as precise delivery of water to
        the
        roots profoundly impacts their overall health and development. Some irrigation systems designed for efficiency
        and minimal human intervention have been designed in the past. Judika et al. discuss automated sprinkler and
        monitoring systems specifically designed for chili plants in urban settings. These systems use a combination
        of
        soil moisture sensors and Arduino controllers to regulate watering based on the soil's moisture content.
        Sensor fusion
        Sensor fusion is an essential component for plant monitoring. It is necessary to integrate data from various
        sources such as moisture, humidity, light and temperature to ensure precise soil humidity management and
        optimal
        plant health. Previous research by Misra et al. offers examples into how sensor fusion is able to enhance IoT
        functionality by combining multiple sensor inputs to achieve more accurate, robust and reliable models of the
        physical environment. Applying sensor fusion is important, as the results of efficient sensor fusion are
        almost
        always better than those obtained from the interpretation of data from individual sensors [5]. However, there
        are many challenges to implementing sensor fusion within the constraints of IoT. Handling voluminous and
        heterogeneous data efficiently, ensuring real-time processing and maintaining scalability, as discussed by
        Krishnamurthi et al. Additionally, research focusing specifically on sensor fusion for houseplant environments
        remains scarce, underscoring a significant gap in current studies.

      <p>The project proposes the creation of the Green Guardian, an IoT device designed to simplify plant care to a
        near-autonomous level. This device will manage watering schedules based on soil humidity data it collects,
        adjusting water delivery to the specific needs of each plant.</p>
      <img src="assets/Implementation/imp1.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" alt="Implementation Diagram"
        class="implementation-diagram">

      <p>Key components of the device include sensors for soil moisture, ambient light, and temperature, a water
        delivery system, and a power management unit featuring solar energy harvesting. This integrated system ensures
        that plants receive optimal care without requiring constant human intervention.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Product Survey - Preliminary Data</h2>
      <p>A survey was conducted with 119 participants to gauge potential user interest in the Green Guardian. Questions
        aimed to assess how often individuals interact with their plants and their interest in a self-sustaining plant
        care system.</p>

      <p>The survey results for the Green Guardian product reveal promising insights into the market's readiness and
        potential interest in an autonomous plant care solution. A majority of respondents interact with their plants
        frequently (daily or several times a week), indicating an existing commitment to plant care that the Green
        Guardian could support and enhance. Additionally, a significant number of respondents reported having plants
        that died prematurely, suggesting a prevalent challenge in maintaining plant health that the Green Guardian aims
        to address. Importantly, the strong inclination towards a self-contained watering system, with a substantial
        majority expressing interest, underscores the demand for such innovative solutions. This interest, coupled with
        respondents' willingness to invest in the price range of $20 to $60, positions the Green Guardian as a viable
        product in the houseplant care market.</p>

      <h2> Sensor Selection, Fusion and Calibration</h2>
      <p>Environmental factors that affect plant growth and  include light, temperature, water, humidity and nutrition.​[16] 
         The first four parameters: light, temperature, humidity and soil moisture (through watering) are readily 
         measurable using cost-effective off-the-shelf sensors, which we procured. Nutrition is tougher to sense and 
         requires more expensive approaches such as spectroscopy, wifi signal, pH, ion-selective electrodes.​ Since our
         design goals require an affordable solution, we decided to forgo the pH sensor (cheapest option would cost $70).
      </p>
      <p>As we do not want affordability of the system to compromise the quality, we needed to calibrate the sensors so
         that the data they produce is reliable. We began with calibrating our DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The 
         below method involved taking initial readings from the sensor and comparing it to the temperature and humidity 
         values as measured by an iPhone. We then calibrated the sensor readings to the correct value through one-stop calibration.</p>

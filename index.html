      <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Green Guardian</strong> project addresses substantial economic losses in the houseplant industry,
        where a significant portion of plants perish annually due to neglect. This <strong>IoT device</strong>
        simplifies plant care to a near-autonomous level, focusing primarily on <strong>precise soil humidity
          management</strong> through its integrated watering system. Once installed, Green Guardian monitors soil
        moisture and <em>adjusts watering schedules accordingly</em>, ensuring plants receive exactly what they need
        without risk of over or underwatering. It also monitors environmental factors such as light and temperature and
        advises owners when adjustments are needed to maintain optimal conditions. Powered by an
        <strong>energy-harvesting system</strong>, the device minimizes its environmental footprint and operates
        independently of external power sources. With its <strong>cloud-connected capabilities</strong>, Green Guardian
        offers users remote monitoring and minimal interaction, making it an ideal solution for ensuring plant health
        with little to no effort. This device not only promises to extend the life of houseplants but also to transform
        plant care into a hassle-free, sustainable routine.</p>

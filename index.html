      <h2>Energy Harvesting</h2>
      <p>Green Guardian is powered by advanced energy harvesting technology, which captures and utilizes ambient energy
        from the environment. This sustainable power source reduces the need for external electrical power, making our
        device eco-friendly and efficient.</p>

        delivering the exact amount of water your plants need, Green Guardian prevents overwatering and underwatering,
        promoting healthier plant growth.</p>
